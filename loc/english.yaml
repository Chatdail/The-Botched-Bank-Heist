heist_jambank_name: "The Botched Bank Heist"
heist_jambank_briefing: "The Coliopa Coin Cache is one of the most sought after collectors items in the world, and I simply must have them. They are in the process of being transferred over to a museum, but due to a scheduling conflict they will be sitting idle in a small bank for a few days. This is where you come in. My driver will take you to the bank, where you storm in and find the vault before people realize what's happening. I've asked around in a few chatrooms and learnt that with thermite you can burn open the vault door no problem. After it's open, you should be able to take the coins and zipline them across the river to my boat. Once you got enough I've arranged some diving equipment for you to make your escape with.\nA simple but bulletproof plan, right?"
heist_jambank_crimenet: "A private collector would like your help in hitting a bank for a large shipment of millennia old coins. He says he has a rock solid plan and should be a straight forward job.\n\n»Locate the vault\n»Use thermite to open the vault\n»Steal the coins\n»Escape via the river"

hud_heist_jambank1_hl: "Investigate the Vault"
hud_heist_jambank1: "The cops were expecting you and caused a big ruckus. The vault is surely secured by now, go and check out how."
hud_heist_jambank2_hl: "Find the manager"
hud_heist_jambank2: "The way to the vault is locked by a security gate, only the bank manager has the code. Find him in the upstairs office, he might be hidden somewhere."
hud_heist_jambank3_hl: "Escort the manager to the time lock"
hud_heist_jambank3: "Get the manager to the time lock so he can enter the code. Make sure he doesn't run away."
hud_heist_jambank4_hl: "Get the correct code and start the time lock"
hud_heist_jambank4: "Shout at the manager until he enters the correct code to start the timelock. You might also need a keycard for the keypad."
hud_heist_jambank5_hl: "Wait for the time lock"
hud_heist_jambank5: "Wait for the timelock to open the security gate. Don't let the cops stop it"
hud_heist_jambank6_hl: "Unpause the time lock"
hud_heist_jambank6: "The timelock has been stopped. Use the keypad to start it again."
hud_heist_jambank7_hl: "Find the security box and cut the correct wires"
hud_heist_jambank7: "Security measures have lockdown the panel. Check which cables are connected to the side of the keypad that has a green light, then find a security box and cut those same wires in order."
hud_heist_jambank8_hl: "Go outside and wait for the driver"
hud_heist_jambank8: "The thermite you need was left in the trunk of the car. Get out on the road and wait for the driver to bring it you."
hud_heist_jambank9_hl: "Take the thermite and use it on the vault"
hud_heist_jambank9: "The driver made his last delivery, take the thermite from the trunk and use it on the vault to burn off the handle"
hud_heist_jambank10_hl: "Wait for the thermite to burn through"
hud_heist_jambank10: "Wait until the thermite finished burning through the vault door handle. In the meantime, perhaps you could find a way to open the shutters to the deposit boxes. Maybe a laptop could open them."
hud_heist_jambank11_hl: "Use the thermite on the vault"
hud_heist_jambank11: "Burn the vault handle off with the thermite you definetly have on you."
hud_heist_jambank12_hl: "Drill the vault"
hud_heist_jambank12: "The thermite didn't fully open the vault, use a drill to open the remaining security measures."
hud_heist_jambank13_hl: "Open the vault"
hud_heist_jambank13: "The vault has no more security measures, time to open it."
hud_heist_jambank14_hl: "Steal and secure the coins"
hud_heist_jambank14: "Take the coins from their boxes and secure them in the boat using the ziplines."
hud_heist_jambank15_hl: "Secure more loot or escape"
hud_heist_jambank15: "You can stay and secure more loot, or get down to the river and escape."

clt_jambank_intro_01: "The bank's just around the corner... Oh shit, a police blockade. We're here, get out quick!"
clt_jambank_01_1: "What? How did the cops know we were coming? You'll have to be quick now. Check the vault, see if the alarm activated any security measures."
clt_jambank_02_1: "Rats! A security gate. It needs a code and probably only the manager knows what it is. He has to be in his office upstairs, get up there and find him."
clt_jambank_03_1: "Oh come on, get that door open."
clt_jambank_04_1: "Who could have tipped them off? But I thought of everything."
clt_jambank_04_2: "This was supposed to be an easy hit, I had it all planned out, what went wrong?"
clt_jambank_05_1: "Wait where is he? No way, he must have hid somewhere. Open up all the cupboards."
clt_jambank_06_1: "There you go, I knew he'd still be there *nervous laugh*. Get him down to the keypad, and make sure he doesn't try anything funny."
clt_jambank_07_1: "He's getting away!"
clt_jambank_07_2: "Hey, don't let him run away!"
clt_jambank_07_3: "Look out, Mr. manager is booking it!"
clt_jambank_08_1: "Convince him to enter the code, a little verbal motivation should do it."
clt_jambank_09_1: "It needs a keycard, of course it does. Try looking around the bank area or offices for one."
clt_jambank_10_1: "Wrong code, shout at him some more."
clt_jambank_10_2: "Is he trying to be funny? Try motivating him again."
clt_jambank_10_3: "Not the code we need, keep cracking him."
clt_jambank_11_1: "Alright good. There's still a timelock, but we can get back to the plan after that. Do your jobs always end up like this?"
clt_jambank_12_1: "Hold on, were those chatrooms public? Oh god damnit they had me tracked the whole time."
clt_jambank_12_2: "Oh, I might have asked around for vault cracking techniques on... slightly, public forums... Whoops."
clt_jambank_13_1: "*gasp* What now? A security lockdown, are you serious? Can you check on the keypad for me?"
clt_jambank_14_1: "Ah okay, look at the color and order of the cables on the side of the panel thats lit up, then find a security box and cut those same colored cables in the same order. That should lift the lockdown."
clt_jambank_15_1: "To lift the security lockdown, check which side of the keypad is lit up and remember the cables connected to it. Then find a security box and cut those same colored cables in the same order."
clt_jambank_16_1: "Oh you are super, security lockdown disabled. Go and restart the timelock."
clt_jambank_17_1: "That's the wrong cables! But the lockdown is lifted and nothing seems to have happened. Restart the timelock, maybe its fine."
clt_jambank_18_1: "Finally, we're inside. Now, just put the thermite on the vault door."
clt_jambank_19_1: "Uhm, you did bring the thermite right?"
clt_jambank_20_1: "*sigh* ...Are you kidding me."
clt_jambank_21_1: "Mick? Mick! Ah nooooh, his souffles were so good! *moves on* Take the thermite from the trunk and place it on the vault door, it will get it right open."
clt_jambank_22_1: "Good, shouldn't take long for it to burn through. In the meantime try opening those deposit boxes, I'll let you keep everything from those."
clt_jambank_23_1: "Did the.... did the door handle just fall off without opening the vault? But, it must have burned through enough internals right? Put a drill on it, that should finish the job. *weak hehe*"
clt_jambank_24_1: "The drill is done, try opening the vault and fingers crossed?"
clt_jambank_25_1: "It opened? I mean, of course it did, just as planned. And the coins are there! Gimme gimme gimme."
clt_jambank_26_1: "You can set up a zipline to secure all the loot. My boat is already on the scene."
clt_jambank_27_1: "Hey that laptop can remotely open the deposit box shutters if your bring it near them, good find."
clt_jambank_29_1: "Did you know some of these coins depict an infamously unlucky king? They say anyone he got in contact with was struck with bad fortune, which if I come to think of it..."
clt_jambank_30_1: "Amazing, that's all I require from you. I strongly advise you take all the coins, but if you really wish to go, head down to the river for your arranged extraction."
clt_jambank_31_1: "Ooh shit, that turret must be the result of cutting the wrong cables. Good luck I guess."
