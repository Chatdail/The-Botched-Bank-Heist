heist_jambank_name: "The Botched Bank Heist"
heist_jambank_briefing: "The Colicopia Coin Cache is one of the most sought after collectors items in the world, and I simply must have them. They are in the process of being transferred over to a museum, but due to a scheduling conflict they will be sitting idle in a small bank for a few days. This is where you come in. My driver will take you to the bank, where you storm in and find the vault before people realize what's happening. I've asked around in a few chatrooms and learnt that with thermite you can burn open the vault door no problem. After it's open, you should be able to take the coins and zipline them across the river to my boat. Once you got enough I've arranged some diving equipment for you to make your escape with.\nA simple but bulletproof plan, right?"
heist_jambank_crimenet: "A private collector would like your help in hitting a bank for a large shipment of millennia old coins. He says he has a rock solid plan and should be a straight forward job.\n\n»Locate the vault\n»Use thermite to open the vault\n»Steal the coins\n»Escape via the river"

hud_heist_jambank1_hl: "Investigate the Vault"
hud_heist_jambank1: "The cops were expecting you and caused a big ruckus. The vault is surely secured by now, go and check out how."
hud_heist_jambank2_hl: "Find the manager"
hud_heist_jambank2: "The way to the vault is locked by a security gate, only the bank manager has the code. Find him in the upstairs office, he might be hidden somewhere."
hud_heist_jambank3_hl: "Escort the manager to the time lock"
hud_heist_jambank3: "Get the manager to the time lock so he can enter the code. Make sure he doesn't run away."
hud_heist_jambank4_hl: "Get the correct code and start the time lock"
hud_heist_jambank4: "Shout at the manager until he enters the correct code to start the timelock. You might also need a keycard for the keypad."
hud_heist_jambank5_hl: "Wait for the time lock"
hud_heist_jambank5: "Wait for the timelock to open the security gate. Don't let the cops stop it"
hud_heist_jambank6_hl: "Unpause the time lock"

hud_heist_jambank7_hl: "Find the security box and cut the correct wires"

hud_heist_jambank11_hl: "Use the thermite on the vault"
hud_heist_jambank11: "Burn the vault handle off with the thermite you definetly have on you."

clt_jambank_end_01:  "Well we sure had some hickups along the way, but it went pretty well dont you think? Enjoy your payment fellas, and pour one out for old Mick."
clt_jambank_intro_01: "The bank's just around the corner... Oh shit, a police blockade. We're here, get out quick!"
clt_jambank_01_1: "What? How did the cops know we were coming? You'll have to be quick now. Check the vault, see if the alarm activated any security measures."
clt_jambank_02_1: "Rats! A security gate. It needs a code and probably only the manager knows what it is. He has to be in his office upstairs, get up there and find him."
clt_jambank_03_1: "Oh come on, get that door open."
clt_jambank_04_1: "Who could have tipped them off? I had thought of everything"
clt_jambank_04_2: "This was supposed to be an easy hit, I had planned it all out, what went wrong?"
clt_jambank_05_1: "Wait where is he? No way, he must have hid somewhere. Open up all the cupboards and check for him."
clt_jambank_06_1: "There you go, I knew he'd still be there. Get him down to the keypad, and make sure he doesn't try anything funny."
clt_jambank_07_1: "He's getting away! Get him!"
clt_jambank_07_2: "Hey, don't let him get away!"
clt_jambank_07_3: "Look out, Mr. manager is booking it!"
clt_jambank_08_1: "Convince him to enter the code, a little verbal motivation should do it."
clt_jambank_09_1: "It needs a keycard, of course it does. Try looking around the bank area or offices for one."
clt_jambank_10_1: "Wrong code, keep shouting at him."
clt_jambank_10_2: "Is he trying to be funny? Try motivating him again."
clt_jambank_10_3: "Gave us the wrong code, keep cracking him."
clt_jambank_11_1: "Alright good. There's still a timelock, but we can get back to the plan after that. Do your plans always end up like this?"
clt_jambank_12_1: "Hold on, were those chatrooms public? Oh they had me tracked the entire damn time."
clt_jambank_12_2: "Okay, I might have asked around for vault cracking techniques on, slightly, monitored forums... Oops."
clt_jambank_13_1: "What now? A security lockdown, are you serious? Can you check on the keypad for me?"
clt_jambank_14_1: "Ah okay, look at the color and order of the cables on the side of the keypad thats lit up, then find a security box and cut those same colored cables in the same order. That should lift the lockdown."
clt_jambank_15_1: "To lift the security lockdown, check which side of the keypad is lit up and remember the cables connected to it. Then find a security box and cut those same colored cables in the same order."
clt_jambank_16_1: "Oh you are great, security lockdown disabled. Now go and restart the timelock."
clt_jambank_17_1: "Something wasn't quite right about those cables... But the lockdown is lifted and nothing seems to have happened. Restart the timelock, maybe it'll be fine."
clt_jambank_18_1: "Finally, we're in. Now, put the thermite on the vault door."
clt_jambank_19_1: "Uhm, you did bring the thermite right?"
clt_jambank_20_1: "You can't be serious."
clt_jambank_21_1: "Mick? Mick! Shit! Okay get the thermite and place it on the vault door. The thermite should cut through the vault like a warm knife through butter."
clt_jambank_22_1: "Good, shouldn't take long for it to burn through. In the meantime try opening those deposit boxes, Anything you find in those are yours to keep."
clt_jambank_23_1: "Did the uh.... did the door handle just fall off without opening the vault? It must have burned through enough internals right? Put a drill on it, that should finish the job. Yea-yeah..."
clt_jambank_24_1: "The drill is done, y'think you could cross your fingers before you open the vault?"
clt_jambank_25_1: "It opened? I mean, of course it did, just as planned. And the coins are there! Fabulous."
clt_jambank_26_1: "You can set up a zipline to secure all the loot. My boat is already on the scene."
clt_jambank_27_1: "Hey that laptop can remotely open the deposit box shutters if your bring it near them, good find."
clt_jambank_29_1: "Did you know some of these coins depict an infamously unlucky king? They say anyone he got in contact with was struck with bad fortune, which if I come to think of it..."
clt_jambank_30_1: "Amazing, that's all I require from you. I strongly advise you take all the coins, but if you really wish to go, head down to the river for your arranged extraction."
clt_jambank_31_1: "Oh shit, that turret must be the result of cutting the wrong cables. Good luck I guess."
drv_jambank_01: "I think it's still in the car."
drv_jambank_02: "I'm coming back, meet me on the road outside."
drv_jambank_03: "Be there in about ten seconds. There's a lot of heat, so be quick."
drv_jambank_04: "Incoming, going to stop at the end of the road.... Oh shit!"
